steps for my portfolio:
1. front page
<!DOCTYPE html>) used to build the structure of a webpage.
lang="en" declares that the language of the page is English.
<meta charset="UTF-8">
Sets character encoding to UTF-8 so it can display most characters correctly.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Makes your page responsive. It ensures the layout adjusts to different screen sizes (mobile-friendly).
<title>WELCOME TO DIYA'S WORLD</title>
The title appears in the browser tab.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
Connects your external CSS file (style.css) for styling (colors, layout, fonts, etc.).
