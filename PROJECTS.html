                <h1>Weather Prediction Project</h1>
                <p>Recently, I have worked on a project with my two friends on Weather Predictions.</p>
                <p>This project was built as a team project to forecast weather conditions such as temperature in different cities using historical data.</p>
                <p>The goal was to build a tool that helps users easily get real-time weather predictions through a user-friendly interface. The language used was Python.</p>
                <p>As part of a collaborative team, I worked primarily on the backend development using Flask to handle API requests and data processing.</p>
                <p>I contributed to building the predictive model using historical weather data and machine learning algorithms. My task was to pre-process the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.</p>
